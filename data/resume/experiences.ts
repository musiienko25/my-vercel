Many IoT products carry the claim of being built for the end user without requiring deep technical knowledge. When speaking to customers and other practitioners, we realized that there were still pain points when it came to configuring hardware.

This software reduces the barriers to entry for less experienced users while allowing professionals to manage their deployments more diligently.",
